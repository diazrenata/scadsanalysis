This is really interesting.

  - Shannonâ€™s is consistently low for most of the datasets. As with
    skewness and evenness, FIA has the lowest % of extremes.
  - However, Gentry is actually more pronouncedly too **high** - 30% of
    sites are above the 95th.

The ones that come out as high are concentrated in the small region of
FIA and the region of Gentry where N is closest to S. These Gentry plots
are also responsible for similar behavior (not discussed in the main ms)
in the other metrics.

That is, for these datasets where N/S is relatively small, the observed
SADs are tending to be more even than the feasible set.
