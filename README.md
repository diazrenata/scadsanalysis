# scadsanalysis
Research compendium comparing species abundance distributions to statistical baselines (their feasible sets). 


## To replicate these analyses

### Re-running the analysis

The full analytical pipeline can be replicated by installing `scadsanalysis` as an R package and running a series of scripts. It requires large amounts of memory and storage (terabytes), and needs parallelization to run in a reasonable amount of time. We run it on the UF HiPerGator, and you'll need to change the settings to work with a different cluster.

For those interested in replicating a subset of the analyses with less compute, we are developing a demo pipeline with a subset of data that can run on a personal computer.
